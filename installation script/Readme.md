# Configuration and installation script for macOS

This script automatically installs [softwares](MacApps.md) and configures some parameters right after the macOS installation.

‚ö†Ô∏è This script is based on my needs. You'll have to change it before any use! ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Explanation

This script only works through the CLI through the use of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) and [mas](https://github.com/lra/mackup).  

You'll have to be administrator to use it.  
Of course you need to have an Apple account to have acces to the Mac App Store (_through **mas**_) and the apps have to be link to this account before you install them.  

‚úãüèªOnly tested on a macOS Sierra virtual machine by now. ‚ÅâÔ∏è

This script is heavily based on [this one](https://github.com/nicolinuxfr/macOS-post-installation/).
