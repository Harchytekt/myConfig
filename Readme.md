# My macOS configuration
[![Platform][platform-badge]][platform-url]

You can find here all my configurations files.  

This repository contains, for now, [Shell files](Configurations/dotfiles/Readme.md) and a [personnalized configuration and installation script](Installation%20script/).  
Furthermore, I've added [the list of apps tp install](Configurations/tools/Brewfile) and [my Neovim configuration](Configurations/configs/neovim/README.md) into the [Configurations folder](Configurations/Readme.md).

- `brew list --cask`
- `brew uninstall warp --cask`
- `brew bundle dump --describe` + `brew bundle`
