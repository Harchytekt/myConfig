# My macOS configuration
[![Platform][platform-badge]][platform-url]

You can find here all my configurations files.  

This repository contains, for now, [four Shell files](Configurations/Shell/Readme.md) and a [personnalized configuration and installation script](Installation%20script/).  
Furthermore, I've added [the list of my apps](Configurations/macApps.md) and [my Atom configuration](Configurations/Atom/Atom.md) into the [Configurations folder](Configurations/Readme.md).
